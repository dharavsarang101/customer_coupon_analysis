Overview

The goal of this project is to use what you know about visualizations and probability distributions to distinguish between customers who accepted a driving coupon versus those that did not.

Data

This data comes to us from the UCI Machine Learning repository and was collected via a survey on Amazon Mechanical Turk. The survey describes different driving scenarios including the destination, current time, weather, passenger, etc., and then ask the person whether he will accept the coupon if he is the driver. Answers that the user will drive there ‘right away’ or ‘later before the coupon expires’ are labeled as ‘Y = 1’ and answers ‘no, I do not want the coupon’ are labeled as ‘Y = 0’. There are five different types of coupons -- less expensive restaurants (under 20), coffee houses, carry out & take away, bar, and more expensive restaurants (
20 - $50).

Contextual attributes

Driving destination: home, work, or no urgent destination
Location of user, coupon and destination: we provide a map to show the geographical location of the user, destination, and the venue, and we mark the distance between each two places with time of driving. The user can see whether the venue is in the same direction as the destination.

Temperature: 30F, 55F, or 80F
Time: 10AM, 2PM, or 6PM
Passenger: alone, partner, kid(s), or friend(s)
Coupon attributes

time before it expires: 2 hours or one day

Analysis:
1. Hypothesis looking at the initial analysis is that the drivers are more prone to buying coupons of Coffee house and cheaper restaurants(<20). People who has no passanger kids with Single, widowed marital status are more prone to accepting bar coupons. 
2. Here the goal is to check the type of coupons accepted and the acceptance rate by the drivers with respect to time of the day(morning, noon, evening, night). Looking at the results, drivers are more prone to accept coupons for Carry out, Restaurants<20 and Coffee house. The coffee house coupons are more prone to be accepted during the day. Also, after 6, people would be more interested in getting a Carry out coupons.
